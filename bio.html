		<p class="headerText"> Hello! <br></p>
		<p class="bodyText"> My name is Jake Preston and I am a Game Design student and Track and Field athlete at the University of California, Irvine. Over the past few years I have worked on a lot of projects as both a designer and programmer. Although I started my journey as a programmer, I fell in love with the design side of games. I love to see my creative vision come to life and work with every single person on my team to make sure we all imprint our creative touch onto the project. <br> <br>

		As a student athlete I am very hard-working and dedicated to my craft. I run Division 1 track and field and have dedicated a large portion of my life to perfecting this, which is something I bring to my game design projects as well. I am also very used to rolling with the punches and adapting to problems as they arise because that is what happens during a track season. I had to learn how to get thrown down and get back up and work around injuries, coaching changes, and bad performance and still execute my best when it matters. <br> <br>

		I truly believe that there are so many untapped ideas and markets within the game design sphere with so much potential, and I thrive on discovering these and bringing innovative game ideas to life. I really enjoy planning out the path a game takes and following the fun through playtests to see what works and what doesnâ€™t, because for me the most important aspect of a game is how fun it is. I want to create memorable experiences that players can carry with them, and I hope that someday my mark will be left on the game industry.
