		<p><em>The Forgotten Dream:</em><br> <br> This is a Game Design Document for a game called The Forgotten Dream, for which I've made an unfinished demo for. This game is a story-rich mystery puzzle game inspired by games like "Other Wilds", "Return of the Obra Dinn", and "Shadows of Doubt". This has been a game I've wanted to develop for a long time and will continue working on in my free time. <br> Link to the Document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15FCNWAf3Hidp5A4sHplRAn_EIt9-i64ACcuEKmPY4NM/edit">Link</a> </p>

		<p><em>Marvel Snap Card Designs:</em><br> <br> For this project I designed 3 new hero cards, 2 new locations and 1 new ability for the mobile game "Marvel Snap". I made sure to make each element as balanced yet unique and fun as possible, experimenting with new ideas that have not been implemented into the game yet. <br> Link to the Document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WPpcT_rEwrAA3XXftdqA164cTpHTlFQkD4kHI7A34Tc/edit">Link</a></p>

		<p><em>Draft Chess: Chess Modification</em><br> <br> For this project I worked with a group to create a modified version of Chess. I wanted to make a major change but ensure that the change did not ruin the fabric of the game. Ultimately I came up with the idea of placing pieces one at a time during set up. This allows each game to be unique, brings a new element of strategy, but keeps the essence of the game as all pieces still move the same and gameplay is exactly the same. <br> Link to the Document:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj1jwth6bDXK3CiBsN50N1cZHE6dtT_VHSAOk1xFqzc/edit">Link</a></p>

		<p><em>Play in Education Essays:</em><br> <br> I wrote two essays about the impact of Play, specifically playing games and playful attitudes, in education, but more specifically higher education. These are an Context Project essay which explains the need for play in higher education, and an Advocacy Project essay which outlines ways to implement play into higher education. Play is the way that everyones learns outside of school, so why is it not utilized more? This is the question I sought to answer, and I could not find a good reason. Play SHOULD be implemented in every classroom no matter how old the students are. <br> Link to the Context Project Essay:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n3hjpmlAxneg2A42Mvi3L8v63hv3XPFVAkgYDTQ6woo/edit">Link</a> <br> Link to the Advocacy Project Essay:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ez8fFoLgDWJz0_T3at0P3RurTBc6qXJEwKn_IxS6RoY/edit">Link</a></p>
