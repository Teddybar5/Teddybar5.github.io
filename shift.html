		<p class="headerText"> Overview <br></p>
		<p class="bodyText"> Time shift is a 3D first person puzzle game where the player must travel through time in order to solve puzzles and escape the facility! This game was created as a part of a group project at my University, UC Irvine. In this game the player has the ability to travel through time to the future and back to the present. The facility they are in looks different depending on what time they are in, and they must use this to solve puzzles and escape.  <br></p>

		<p class="bodyText"> So far we have the intro section of Time Shift. This part teaches the player through in-game wall scrawls and intro puzzles that teaches the player through gameplay and environmental story-telling. The game will eventually open up into a larger metroidvania with 3 different areas, the laboratories, the vents, and the offices, explorable to the player. Eventually the player will need to explore all 3 areas in both the present and future to ultimately unlock the door and escape the facility. There will also be notes and other messages dispersed throughout the facility that explain the story behind what happened here. Ultimately this is an unfinished project that I believe has a lot of potential.<br> </p>
