	<!-- About Me -->
	<div class="about">
		<p><em>About Me</em> <br> <br> Hi! My name is Jake Preston and I am a game designer and programmer from Los Angeles, California. I have been programming and designing games since I was only 10 years old, publishing my first project in my junior year of high school at the age of 17. I have worked as a teacher and counselor teaching kids ages 5-15 how to code and develop video games from scratch at the companies "PlanetBravo" and "Code Ninjas". I am an undergraduate at the University of California Irvine as a Game Design and Interactive Media Major set to graduate in the spring of 2026. I am proficient in Unity and C# as I have been using Unity to develop games for 6 years now. I also have experience designing assets in MagicaVoxel and creating websites, like this portfolio, using HTML and CSS. <br> <br> I love coming up with ideas for new games so I have quite a few unfinished or underdeveloped projects. My favorite part of design is coming up with new and innovative ideas for games. I want to make games that exist to evoke a feeling from the player, and my mind is always full of ten new ideas that I haven't had time to put into reality yet. <br> <br> I also run Division 1 track and field for UCI. In my freshman year, 2023, I competed at the conference championship. I was awarded the "Newcomer of the Year" award for having stellar athletic and academic accomplishments. This award was given to the best newcomer, freshman, or transfer student, across all of athletics. I was also awarded the "Men's Track and Field Scholar-Athlete of the Year" which was given to the top athletic and academic performer across Men's track and field. <br> <br> I hope you enjoy this portfolio, feel free to contact me with any questions!</p>
