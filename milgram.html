      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <div class="meta">March–August 2025 · Unreal Engine 5</div>
      <p>
      Milgram Experiment is a <strong>first-person, 3D psychological horror puzzle game</strong> in which players must fight the system in order to succeed. 
      Players assume the role of a Patriot Test administrator in a fictional authoritarian state, tasked with determining whether citizens 
      are loyal or if they need to be motivated through a brutal electric shock. Originally developed for a horror games course, the project 
      has continued beyond the class. I served as team lead and lead designer, contributing across design, narrative, programming, level 
      creation, and production.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is currently available as a one-encounter demo, with additional scenarios actively in development and planned for future release.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Content Design</h2>
      <p>
        As lead designer, I defined the game’s core vision and tone. Rather than relying on jump scares, the experience focuses on 
        psychological horror inspired by the real-world Milgram Experiment. The game challenges players to confront their own complicity:
         victory is only possible by refusing to harm innocent participants and rebelling against the game’s rules. 
      </p>
      <!-- picture -->
      <p>
        To hammer this theme home I developed a shadow that slowly grows in the corner of the player’s room. At first it is not noticed, 
        but as the player continues to disobey it grows and subtly chants “obey” to sow doubt in the player and to demonstrate the power
         that authoritative figures have.       
      </p>
      <!-- picture -->
      <p>
        A lot of inspiration was taken from the original Milgram experiment, however the questions and themes could not be taken. 
        I wanted to provide in-universe reasons for such a cruel test to exist and to allow players to justify their cruelty, even if 
        that would ultimately lead them towards the bad ending. 
      </p>

      <h2>Level Design</h2>
      <p>
        I designed and implemented the entire environment and lighting. The setting was inspired by Soviet-era scientific facilities, 
        using curated assets alongside custom props created by a team artist, which I integrated and refined in-engine. I received assets
         from the artists on my team and implemented them myself, adjusting materials and lighting to ensure visual cohesion.
      </p>
      <!-- picture -->
      <p>
        Animation and lighting played a critical role in curating the atmosphere. Rather than showing NPC entrances directly, 
        I implemented heavy steel doors to conceal movement and heighten tension. I collaborated with another designer on NPC animations 
        during questioning and punishment sequences. Lighting was carefully composed to focus attention on the test subject, using a 
        single overhead spotlight, while darker corners of the room emphasize the presence of the emerging entity.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Production</h2>
      <p>
        As team lead I was in charge of managing a team of 5 others to get the project finished on time. We had a short deadline of
         2 months from when we started the project since it was due at the end of the class. I used a google doc to manage tasks and 
         held weekly meetings to go over progress updates and delegate upcoming tasks. Rather than push the team using sprints and a 
         more structured development process, I worked around everyone’s busy schedules and if one person had a particularly busy 
         week their workload would be divided between me and anyone else with lighter weeks. This allowed us to stay on track and get a polished build finished by the end of the class that was ready to present and submit. 
      </p>
        <!-- picture -->
      <p>
        I did spend 11 hours straight fighting unreal for a functional build, but that was the day before it was due since I had the
         wherewithal to build early, although I wish I had done so even earlier to avoid the 11 hour battle. 
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>UI</h2>
      <p>
        I created all of the UI for the game. I wanted the UI to feel like it was part of the game world to increase immersion, so I designed 
        the TV pause menu. When you click on the TV it rolls up towards you and a menu is displayed on the screen. This allows the player to adjust
        settings or quit to menu, without breaking immersion by pulling up a traditional pause menu.
      </p>
        <!-- Video of UI -->

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Intro Video</h2>
      <p>
        I also wrote, directed, edited, and even acted in the intro cutscene video that plays at the beginning of the game. I wanted
         to create something that would both immediately immerse the player in the world and set the chilling tone for the game. 
         The patriot test informational video that plays when you first enter the game did just that. 
      </p>
